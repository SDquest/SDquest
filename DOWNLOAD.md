# Availability
SDquest is available for Linux platform. Windows and Mac support is not guaranteed.

# SDquest download
SDquest is written in Java and requires Java Runtime Environment. All the code is available in the "Code" file. 

Information of mosaic SDs for human, gorilla and mouse gneomes are available in "Mosaic_SDs" file, and information of pairwise SDs for human, gorilla and mouse genomes are available in the "Pairwise_SDs" file. 

Note that, pairwise SDs for the "mm10" assembly of mouse genome are contained in two files "PairwiseSDs_Mouse_mm10_a.zip" and "PairwiseSDs_Mouse_mm10_b.zip", since the pairwise SDs for the "mm10" assembly of mouse genome is too big to upload in a single file.
