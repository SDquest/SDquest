Currently, SDquest can handle the following human and mouse genomes downloaded from the UCSC Genome Browser.
Human genome (GRCH37/hg19) : http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/bigZips/
Human genome (GRCH38/hg38): http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg38/bigZips/
Mouse genome (NCBI36/mm8): http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/mm8/bigZips/
Mouse genome (GRCm38/mm10): http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/mm10/bigZips/
Please download both the file “chromFa.tar.gz” and “chromFaMasked.tar.gz” in one of the above links. Unzip these two files and copy all the chromosome files into the directory “GenomeData” under the “SDquest” main directory. Note that the current version SDquest only allows you to handle one genome (in the “GenomeData” folder) at a time.
